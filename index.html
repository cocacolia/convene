So here we are.
The graphic technology was eliminated, as well as the internet. People adopted sewing, bread-burning, hand printing, various types of solar-copy machines, plant-based ink, knitting, sewing and weaving. But all of this requires much more time to produce things and to work overtimes. Therefore, to cope with exhaustion, the simple thing is suggested to designers: breath in, breath out and enjoy a slice of Octopusbread.

"Octopus-bread" is a symbol and the prominent invention of Octomm civilization –– the domestication of octopuses and magic rituals to make them breed into the rare form of bread-creatures. Octopus-bread is still the most leading source of food. With the enlightened by all human progress minds of their community - Octoland people produced extremely self sufficient octo-breeding farms which work on a solar energy and require no electronics.

The philosophy of Octoland is TO BE PRESENT IN THE MOMENT AND BREATH. Breath in... Breath out... The reflections about past or future are not welcomed, as they take you in the dillusion-mode. Information is not censored, but after all, nobody is interested in past. Those who are interested - are unhealthy members of society who want to dig on the past. They are warmly welcomed into into detoxification-zone of maximum security (apparently, kind of a jail), so they can't poison other with their toxic ruminations about the past. 

Octolanders are extreme pacifists. Democracy has faded out, and become merged with the new ideology –– Breadology. The state has monopolized the power by owning a huge army special breed warrior-octopuses with multi-tool tentacle weapons, which sounds epic, but in the reality is quite weak, compared to others armies. So the octolanders are forced to maintain peace and good international relations with other communes through the secret agreement to trade the best Octopus-breads into slavery. Any revolts against this become impossible, as people are enjoying their bare minimum lifestyle. Most the inhabitants of the commune are obligated to attend well-being classes to help themselves to cope with stress (or with stress which is caused by social issues or overtime work) –– yoga in rye fields, pottery-class-hypnosis, even though due to hard-working conditions they need to decrease amount of sleep to attend these well-being classes.
