So here we are. This is the last message from me on the World Wide Web. While you are reading this, I am probably already in the detoxification-zone. I was a designer before... 
But graphic technology was eliminated, as well as the internet and digital communication. Our commune is a "pure" place. People adopted sewing, bread-burning, hand printing, various types of solar-copy machines, plant-based ink, knitting, sewing and weaving. But all of this requires much more time to produce things and to work overtime. Therefore, to cope with exhaustion, the simple thing is suggested to designers: breathe in, breathe out and enjoy a slice of Breadtopus.

"Breadtopus" is a symbol and the prominent invention of Octommm civilization — the domestication of octopuses and magic rituals to make them breed into the rare form of bread-creatures. Octopus-bread is still the most leading source of food. With the enlightened by all human progress minds of this community - Octommmers produced extremely self sufficient octopus-breeding farms which work on a solar energy and require no electronics. Breadtopuses are quite smart and can form complex social structures within their groups. So eating them feels quite cruel. But nobody cares. Because they treat them like bread.

The philosophy of Octommm is TO BE PRESENT IN THE MOMENT AND BREATH. Breath in... Breath out... Ommm.. The reflections about past or future are not welcomed, as they take you in the delusion-mode. Information is not censored, but after all, nobody is interested in the past. Those who are interested – are unhealthy members of society. They are warmly welcomed into the detoxification-zone of maximum security (apparently, kind of a jail), so they can't poison others with their toxic ruminations about the past.
Octommmers are extreme pacifists. Democracy has faded out, and become merged with the new ideology —— Breadology. The state has monopolized the power by owning a huge army of special breed warrior-octopuses with multi-tool tentacle weapons, which sounds epic, but in reality is quite weak, compared to other armies. So the octommmers are forced to maintain peace and good international relations with other communes through the secret agreement to trade the best Breadtopus farmers into slavery where they can produce cheap food and keep technology in secret. Any revolts against this become impossible, as people are enjoying their bare minimum lifestyle while being high from low-dose drugs carried on the wings of specially trained bees and spread in the atmosphere. Most of the inhabitants of the commune are obligated to attend well-being classes to help themselves to cope with stress (or with stress which is caused by social issues or overtime work) -- yoga in rye fields, pottery-class-hypnosis, even though due to hard-working conditions they need to decrease amount of sleep to attend these well-being classes. 
Ok.. I should go, I can hear the sound of bees wings, bzzzzz.
